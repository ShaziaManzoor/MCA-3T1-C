# Design and analysis of Algorithms

## Introduction
Welcome to the course. We are going to use **Java** for implementing the algorithms. Please report any bugs by creating an issue. 

Please note that the usage of the algorithms is demostrated using `junit` tests in the `tests` directory. 

### Divide And Conquer

1. [Max Min](https://github.com/ShaziaManzoor/MCA-3T1-C/tree/master/src/main/java/edu/iust/algorithms/divideandconquer) : Finding the maximum and minimum items in a set of `n` elements using **Divide And Conquer**. You can find the test [here](https://github.com/ShaziaManzoor/MCA-3T1-C/tree/master/src/test/java/edu/iust/algorithms/divideandconquer)
